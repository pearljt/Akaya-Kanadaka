(1) Requirements ---------------------------------------------------------------

Akaya is a calligraphic display typeface for contemporary use. This follows the new 
orthography as commonly seen used today in non-academic settings. Akaya will however 
support basic Sanskrit for both Kannada and Telugu scripts. The typeface is based on
a hybrid model that tries to closely imitate the old way of writing--unaffected by 
the constraints of hot-metal and photo-typesetting era. This would mostly mean 
complex vattu placements which will be pretty complex for Telugu. The line spacing for
Akaya will therefore be affected by this decision. This typeface is an experiment at 
this stage to provide a good quality informal Kannada and Telugu display typeface.
